      <description>When first creating this blog, my initial instincts were to throw it into ExpressionEngine because that&amp;rsquo;s the content management system I&amp;rsquo;m most familiar with.

While the crowd was respectable, Boise fans clearly weren&amp;rsquo;t out in full force for a Friday night game against a team they expected to handle.</description>
