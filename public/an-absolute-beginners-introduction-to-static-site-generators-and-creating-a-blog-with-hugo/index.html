<p>When first creating this blog, my initial instincts were to throw it into <a href="https://expressionengine.com/" target="_BLANK">ExpressionEngine</a> because that&rsquo;s the content management system I&rsquo;m most familiar with. That decision certainly would have worked just fine, but the more I thought about it, I realized that it might be overkill as a developer to have my personal blog in a full-fledged CMS designed to be used by clients who don&rsquo;t know HTML.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d had some limited experience in the past with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_BLANK"> Jekyll</a>, a static site generator (SSG) that seemed to be primarily targeted at developers making personal blogs. There&rsquo;s also nothing wrong that option, but it&rsquo;s built on Ruby and requires a Ruby environment so I really didn&rsquo;t wanna go down that route.</p>

<p>So I decided to research which SSG would be best for me. <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/static-site-generators/" target="_BLANK">Sitepoint</a> does a good job explaining the pros and cons of the more popular ones, but I eventually landed on <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_BLANK">Hugo</a>. I was drawn to Hugo because it&rsquo;s free, advertised as &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s fastest framework for building websites,&rdquo; and because I was already interested in learning <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_BLANK">Golang (Go)</a> which Hugo is built on.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-a-static-site-generator">Why Use a Static Site Generator</h2>

<p>The most obvious distinguishing feature of an SSG is that it doesn&rsquo;t use a database. While that would be a dealbreaker for certain types of sites, it&rsquo;s a benefit for text-based sites like a personal blog. Axing the database instantly means more speed and security for your site.</p>

<p>Instead of relying on the database to dynamically fetch content, you run a build that converts all of your content (usually in Markdown files) into static folders and HTML files that you then push either into a git repository or directly to your site. It&rsquo;s a nice simple process that usually offers more flexibility and requires less hassle than dealing with a monolithic CMS.</p>

<p>One potential drawback of an SSG is that the build process can take some time if you have a large site, but Hugo focuses on speed and can handle complex builds quickly. I was surprised to learn that more and more large websites are relying on SSG&rsquo;s. With the relative simplicity of the personal blog site we&rsquo;re talking about here, the speed of the build wouldn&rsquo;t really be an issue even using a slower SSG.</p>

<p>Just as a point of clarification that initially confused me, static site generators are incredibly similar to flat file CMS&rsquo;s. Both don&rsquo;t use databases and work in the same sort of way, but the main difference is that a flat file CMS generally has a user admin interface similar to a more traditional CMS while an SSG usually relies on the command line. The more you know!</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve talked about what SSG&rsquo;s are and why we&rsquo;re using them, let&rsquo;s get down to actually learning how to start using Hugo.</p>

<p>Although I mentioned that I was interested in learning Go, it should be known that little to no knowledge of the language is required to churn out a basic site with Hugo.</p>
