A few hours before gametime, I made the same trek on foot from the night before into downtown. 

## The Game

The climb up to my seat in the southeast corner of Albertson's Stadium was steeper and more tiring than one would expect at such a relatively small venue. While the crowd was respectable, Boise fans clearly weren't out in full force for a Friday night game against a team they expected to handle. This meant I had plenty of space. 

A woman close to my age who was there with what appeared to be her husband and three children. 

Walking through the concourse at halftime, the only Marshall fan I passed was wearing the same Moss/Pennington '97 t-shirt that I was sporting. We pointed at each other like we were in the Spiderman meme.

The 2nd half was mostly excruciating to sit through. Boise scored immediately to take their first lead at 14-7, and while I was right about that being pretty much the death knell for the Herd, I certainly didn't expect it to be the last score of the game. The mother, taking a break from futily attempting to keep her kids from running around the bleachers, noticed my pessimism when I didn't react to Tavante Beckett's? tipped interception.

"You can cheer for that, you know." 

My reply was a chuckle and something along the lines of "Well, let's see what the offense can do." Turns out the offense couldn't do anything. They didn't get a first down the entire second half. Isaiah Green's 2nd interception with about 8 minutes to go would be the last time the Herd touched the ball as Boise mercilessly ground out the rest of the clock.

I walked down the steep stairs one more time as Marshall's team walked off the field through the tunnel behind the south endzone. That section around the tunnel - close to the field below me - seemed to have a reputation as the rowdiest part of the stadium, similar to Cleveland's Dawg Pound. As part of what I assume to be a regular tradition, they stood and applauded the Herd players for a game effort.

I briefly thought about going back to the dive bar to see what John Candy was up to, but then I remembered I needed to be at the airport in about 8 hours and decided to just make the long walk back to the AirBnB.
